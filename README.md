# Address Book
## About
This project is for [Epicodus'](http://www.epicodus.com/) [Ruby OO assessment](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/ruby-oo-assessment).
This project allows users to create a personal address book where they can store information about people they know.
Users can add name, multiple phone numbers, multiple emails and multiple mailing addresses. They can also list all contacts' names and choose a contact to view all of the information about it. Users are also allowed to edit and delete contacts.

## Setup
Clone this repository or download the .zip. In Terminal open up the folder **address_book**. Run this command **$ruby address_book.rb** and play around with the program.
